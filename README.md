# haskenthetical

Toy language that I'm working on. I have no expectation of it ever going anywhere.

You can read a little about it [on my blog](http://reasonableapproximation.net/2020/05/19/haskenthetical.html), and there are some [examples](https://github.com/ChickenProp/haskenthetical/tree/master/examples), but it's not actually documented.
